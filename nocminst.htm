<hr>

<p>All societies have a variety of traditional ways of managing and resolving conflict.
These may be informal or formal. Respected elders within a family, clan, religious group,
or community may help the people in conflict solve the problem themselves, or may impose a
solution which is seen to be legitimate because of the elder's wisdom and/or position.
Alternatively, formal systems of courts and administrative decision making bodies may be
established to hear and decide a variety of cases. </p>

<p>However, in the case of wars or other major social and political upheavals, the
traditional dispute resolution mechanisms may not function effectively or be in existence
at all. As the former Soviet states and Warsaw pact countries made the transition from
communism to democracy, for example, they disbanded the old court systems and
administrative dispute resolution mechanisms, and had to replace them with new
institutions. This process has not been quick or easy, however, and in the interim, many
disputes have gone unresolved. </p>

<p>Sometimes, traditional institutions remain in place, but they lose their legitimacy.
People may stop using the traditional systems, or they may try them, but when they are
displeased with the outcome, they may defy it, trying to impose a more desirable outcome
by force.</p>

    After the Cold War</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Nye explores the nature and causes of global, regional, and communal conflicts after the
    Cold War and evaluates various approaches to conflict prevention. Breakdown of traditional
    conflict management institutions is one of the causes he cites for these conflicts at all
    levels.</dd>

    the Post-Cold War Era</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>Sahnoun explores issues surrounding military and humanitarian interventions in internal
    national conflicts. Like Nye, Sahnoun observes that the erosion of traditional conflict
    resolution strategies is one cause of these conflicts, and hence one target for
    intervention efforts. </dd>
