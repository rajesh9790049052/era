<p>As is clear from this training program, there are a great many things that need to be
considered before deciding which approach to conflict is most likely to advance a group's
interests. Inevitably, this analysis takes time. Unfortunately, crisis situations can
develop in which there is very little time to consider available options.&nbsp; In these
cases, parties who are unable or unwilling to act quickly are at a severe disadvantage,
which means that people are often forced to make decisions without adequate information.
&nbsp; Obviously, such decisions are often poor.&nbsp; In the most extreme example, the
nuclear standoff between the United States and the Soviet Union, there were enormous
pressures to fire nuclear weapons within minutes or even seconds of an attack warning.
Under such circumstances, a false alarm could easily result in catastrophe. &nbsp;&nbsp;
Although a variety of approaches can help deal with crisis situations, the best solution
is prevention--dealing with conflicts constructively before crises develop, so that quick,
bad decisions--and potentially catastrophic situations--can be avoided.</p>

<p><strong><!--webbot bot="PurpleText" PREVIEW="Counterforce strategies often produce a stalemate in which both sides recognize that they do not have force-based options needed for victory.&nbsp; Often this involves a tense cease-fire in which&nbsp; military forces are ready to go into action&nbsp; at any moment. &nbsp; This armed standoff can however become highly unstable. This is because the party which strikes first often enjoys a substantial military advantage. Often the parties conclude that they can win if they take the initiative and strike first, but that they will lose if they give the other party the initiative to allow them to strike first. ??This is especially likely to occur in situations dominated by a small number of high-technology weapons?&quot;?? In cases were the parties believes this to be the situation both sides are under enormous pressure to start the war once they conclude that war is inevitable.   ADD MURPHY'S LAW" --></strong></p>
