<hr>

<p>Many violent conflicts are associated with grotesque and terrible violations of human
rights. War crimes and acts of genocide violate the most fundamental and broadly accepted
principles of human conduct. These crimes present two basic challenges. </p>

<h3>Stopping Ongoing War Crimes</h3>

<p>First, there is the question of how one stops ongoing war crimes and violations of
human rights.&nbsp;War crimes and genocide are usually the result of extreme escalation,
polarization, and dehumanization.&nbsp; Opponents' images of the enemy can become so
distorted that they do not see the other side as human at all, only as villains whose very
existence is a threat to one's own way of life.&nbsp; Once people are seen in this way,
their destruction becomes not only acceptable, but apparently essential for one's own
group.&nbsp; Traditional social norms and mores that would prevent extreme acts of
violence and destruction aimed toward one's own group dissolve when the victim is a member
of the opposing group.&nbsp; Such acts of violence can even be viewed as heroic by one's
own people, who see them as valiant efforts to preserve their own identity and way of
life.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Several factors make such situations very difficult to deal with.&nbsp; First is the
traditional concept of sovereignty.&nbsp; This concept is generally taken to mean that
nation states control their own internal affairs, including decisions about appropriate
ways of defining and dealing with crimes, and ways of treating minority populations.
Because the concept of sovereignty has long been recognized as legitimate in the
international system, individual nations (and the United Nations) have often been
reluctant to intervene in conflicts which are internal to one state, even when terrible
human rights abuses are being committed.&nbsp; This means that victims often are largely
helpless, because the international community feels that it cannot or should not intervene
in a country's &quot;internal affairs.&quot;</p>

<p>Another factor that makes such situations difficult is that both sides may be guilty of
war crimes or human rights violations, and hence consider themselves to be
&quot;victims.&quot; When this occurs, conflicts can escalate and reach a stalemate even
more quickly, as both sides feel (rightfully) that they have been severely wronged, and
that the other side should make amends and/or be punished severely for its behavior.
&nbsp; When both sides feel this way, it can become very difficult to redefine the
conflict or re-frame it in a more positive way, or to start building up trust and mutual
understandings between the groups.</p>

<h3><strong>Addressing Past War Crimes</strong></h3>

<p>The second challenge arises once the war has ended or the perpetrator of the human
rights abuses has been removed from power and societies are struggling to come to terms
with the tragedy.&nbsp; Torture, killings, genocide are not quickly forgotten or
forgiven--making a return to &quot;normal&quot; a very slow and difficult process. &nbsp;
New regimes are faced with a difficult decision about whether to prosecute criminals for
their acts or to grant amnesty in an effort to forgive, forget, and move on. As the
attached readings illustrate, there are costs and benefits to both approaches, and the
decision about which way to go is seldom clear.&nbsp; . On the one hand, victims of these
terrible crimes, understandably find it impossible to simply forget about the crimes and
live in a society with the perpetrators as if nothing happened. For them some measure of
justice is likely to be an essential part of the healing process. On the other hand, if
the victims of such crimes insist on severe punishments for everyone associated with these
crimes&nbsp; (including those who &nbsp; played only a minor role),&nbsp; They run the
risk of an all-out fight to the death rather than reconciliation and healing. </p>
