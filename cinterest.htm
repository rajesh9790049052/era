<hr>

<p>The results of fact-finding efforts can either strengthen or weaken the position of
particular parties. There is, therefore, a great deal of incentive for the parties to
manipulate the fact-finding process in ways which strengthen their position. Not
surprisingly, people are skeptical and disbelieving of fact-finding efforts that say
things that they do not want to hear. This is especially true in cases where it is likely
that opponents&nbsp; have manipulated the fact-finding process. </p>

<p>This skepticism can easily reach the point where fact-finding efforts have almost no
credibility and the parties simply believe what they want to believe. The result can be an
almost complete inability to utilize expert technical analyses in a decision making
process. This increases the chances that the parties will, in their ignorance, pursue
options which will not really advance their interests. Thus, the first problem which
fact-finding efforts must surmount is credibility problems. Here, treatment strategies
require mechanisms for assuring that fact-finding efforts are worthy of each party's
trust, and that this trustworthiness is effectively demonstrated to the parties, the
decision makers, and to the public as a whole.</p>

    Radiation Monitoring Program </strong></a></dt>
  <dd>This is a description of the aftermath of the accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear
    power plant in Pennsylvania (U.S.) Residents' fears about potential risks of cleanup
    activities were high due to distrust of the plant operators and regulators.&nbsp; The
    described Citizen Radiation Monitoring Program solved the credibility problem and allowed
    the clean up to go ahead as planned.</dd>

    Foothills Case)</a></strong></dt>
  <dd>In this case study, each of the parties collected their own data which led to a
    credibility problem as each was seen by the other to have a conflict of interest.</dd>
