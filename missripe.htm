<hr>

<p>Disputes usually become &quot;ripe&quot; for negotiation once each disputant's
alternative options (or BATNAs) have been clarified and compared. When all the parties
know their options and their relative level of power, they are in a position to negotiate
a settlement to their dispute which accurately reflects their relative power structures,
but which can be obtained at much lower cost than would occur if the power strategies were
played out &quot;to the bitter end.&quot; This commonly occurs when one person or group
files a lawsuit. Both the plaintiff and the defendant (that is, the accuser and the
accused) develop a plan for the case and go through the preliminary legal stages of
motions, hearings, and discovery (a process in which each side asks questions of the other
which must be answered). As this processes is concluded, it usually becomes fairly obvious
to all which side has the winning case, long before the trial actually takes place. The
parties can then negotiate to settle their dispute out of court, thus avoiding further
delay, court costs, and the risk of an unexpectedly bad outcome for either side. It can be
said that the preliminary legal activities make many disputes &quot;ripe&quot; for
settlement. Sometimes, however, such ripe moments are overlooked, and the parties proceed
to the full trial. The result is usually similar to what they would have gotten had they
negotiated earlier, but the transaction costs are higher. </p>

<p>Sometimes, such ripe moments are missed by accident. Disputants may be so entrenched in
their confrontational strategy that they may ignore situations in which negotiations would
likely be successful. In other cases, negotiation is rejected intentionally. If power
contests are ended prematurely by settlement negotiations, there is always the possibility
that the outcome could have been different, had the power contest been pursued until the
bitter end. When the stakes are high, parties often fall victim to what we call the
&quot;going down in flames syndrome&quot; in which people who are losing a dispute
stubbornly pursue the power contest to the bitter end, hoping that somehow they can
eventually turn the situation around and win. Thus they let &quot;ripe&quot; moments for
negotiation go by, continuing the power struggle no matter what the cost. Along with the
overuse of force and miscalculating the power balance, the &quot;down in flames&quot;
syndrome is one of the most destructive conflict problems.</p>

<p>However, it is also important not to pursue resolution solely for the sake of
resolution. Resolution of the immediate dispute should seldom be the ultimate goal. It
might be a worthy intermediate goal, but the ultimate goals should still be the building
of constructive relationships and the making of fair and wise decisions over the short and
long terms.</p>

  <dd>Often ripe moments are missed because potential third parties assume they must wait
    until both sides are exhausted and longing for peace.&nbsp; But early intervention can
    sometimes be successful, Crocker maintains, and thereby avoids tremendous suffering and
    bloodshed.</dd>
  <dt><a href="../example/rubi2278.htm"><strong>Jeffery Rubin --Negotiation Timing</strong></a></dt>
  <dd>In this essay on negotiation timing, Rubin makes the similar point that the concept of
    &quot;ripeness&quot; is sometimes used as an excuse to procrastinate which makes effective
    intervention later all the more difficult.</dd>
