<p></strong>When developing a strategy for dealing with conflict situations, people often
make the assumption that their strategy will work as planned. They often fail to consider
all of the things that could go wrong and the likelihood that unwanted and unexpected
outcomes will produce undesirable results.&nbsp; This failure to consider the risks
associated with alternative conflict strategies often leads people to repeatedly and
unnecessarily expose themselves to undesirable and potentially catastrophic outcomes. This
&quot;best case planning&quot; is especially dangerous in situations where the potential
for all-out violence exists. <font FACE="Times New Roman">For example, parties who launch
a military attack may find that they under-estimated their opponents' defenses and that
the result will be defeat, and not victory. The same thing could happen to parties who
abandon negotiation in hopes of winning everything that they want in an election or court
case. &nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
