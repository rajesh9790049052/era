<hr>

<p>While people tend to resent being forced to do things against their will, the level of
resentment increases dramatically when the force is seen as illegitimate. For example,
most people think that it is legitimate for the police to enforce rules against reckless
driving which endangers others. If people are arrested for reckless driving, they might
resent it, but their resentment is likely to be limited if they know that they are guilty.
Furthermore, their fellow citizens are likely to believe that the police were doing the
right thing. If, on the other hand, the police were to threaten innocent drivers with
reckless driving charges as a means of extracting bribes, this would be widely seen as
illegitimate. The result is likely to be widespread resentment and hostility toward the
police and government in general. It is also widely seen as illegitimate to ask officials
to act in ways which clearly violate their responsibilities and would produce unfair
decisions which would greatly favor one group over another. Similarly, use of military
forces for conquest is widely seen as illegitimate; consequently, it is likely to produce
an intense backlash effect. However, the use of military force to block aggression or acts
of genocide is much more likely to be viewed as legitimate. </p>

<p>Force is also commonly viewed as illegitimate if it is seen as excessive and
unnecessary.&nbsp; For example,&nbsp;it&nbsp; is generally considered&nbsp; inappropriate
for parties to file a lawsuit before they try to negotiate a voluntary resolution of their
complaint. Similarly, it is usually illegitimate&nbsp; for military force to be used
before diplomatic options are exhausted.&nbsp; In a similar way, the use deadly force by
the police is commonly viewed as illegitimate, unless there is truly no other way to
protect the public (and the police officers). Also, it is generally considered
inappropriate for workers to call a strike before they have honestly tried to negotiate an
acceptable labor contract. </p>

<p>Although any use of force can generate resentment, steps which increase legitimacy are
likely to reduce the <a href="forop2-p.htm">backlash effect</a>, hence increasing the
likelihood that force will succeed over both the short and long terms.&nbsp; Parties which
are being subjected to illegitimate uses of force are also more likely to attract
sympathizers and allies. Conversely,&nbsp; parties which use force in legitimate ways are
more likely to attract sympathizers and allies. These effects are likely to be especially
strong for those who have not yet decided which side of a conflict to support. </p>

    Negotiations in the Gulf </strong></a></dt>
  <dd>This short essay argues that the Gulf War occurred in part because the U.S. and its
    allies were unwilling to consider or wait long enough for nonviolent force-based options
    (such as economic sanctions) to work. The resulting war, Peachy and others suggests was
    unnecessary and excessively destructive.</dd>
