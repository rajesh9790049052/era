<hr>

<p>When people or groups are in conflict, communication between them tends to get worse
and worse. As a conflict escalates, people limit their direct contact with people on the
other side, because such conflict is uncomfortable or threatening. They also tend to
assume that they have &quot;heard it all before,&quot; that there is nothing new to be
learned from listening to what the opponent says or thinks. Thus, they tend to get their
information from &quot;internal sources&quot;--from talking and listening to each other,
and from rumors. Eventually all direct communication between parties may be cut off.
Sometimes, communication is cut off in protest, as when an ambassador is recalled from a
country in response to an act or statement which the host country made or did. Although
this clearly exhibits displeasure, it does nothing to resolve the situation; rather it
makes the chances of resolution more remote. </p>

<p>In describing the escalation process (or what they call the &quot;spiral of unmanaged
conflict,&quot;) Susan Carpenter and W.J.D. Kennedy (1988, p. 13) write &quot;in the early
stages of conflict, people talked with each other and exchanged opinions. But somewhere
along the way public discussions turned to public debate. People are frustrated by the
situation and angry at each other. They become intolerant of other points of view and lose
interest in talking about perspectives other than their own. Listening to counterpoints is
unpleasant because they have invested heavily in one side of the argument and this is not
time for second thoughts. As a result, conversation between the parties stops, and
information is used as a weapon to promote a position or win a point. Information that
would lead to a solution no longer flows between the parties.&quot;</p>

<p>Deutsch (1973, p. 353) agrees, observing that in escalated conflicts, &quot;available
communication channels and opportunities are not utilized, or they are used in an attempt
to mislead or intimidate the other. Little confidence is placed in information that is
obtained directly from the other; espionage and other circuitous means of obtaining
information are relied upon.&quot; Like rumors, such information collection process are
highly prone to error and are very likely to escalate the conflict even further.</p>
