fields have developed a large number of comprehensive strategies for dealing with
difficult conflict problems.&nbsp; These approaches typically combine several of the
treatment strategies&nbsp; described earlier in his training program.&nbsp; In addition,
many strategies cannot be categorized simply as force-based, integrative, or
exchange-based strategies, because they are a combination of two or three of these
approaches.&nbsp; The following section contains descriptions of these combination
strategies as well as information about how each approach relates to the ideas presented
in this training program.</p>
