<p>We use the term &quot;integrative power&quot; to refer to the power that holds people
and societies together.&nbsp; It is the bonds--the feelings of commonality, belonging, of
respect-- that people have with others in their own &quot;group.&quot;&nbsp; (By
&quot;group&quot; we mean family, or community, or religion, or workplace, or
ethnicity--any source of identity that helps people feel as if they are part of one group,
which is distinct from another.)&nbsp; Although it is not commonly considered a source of
power, leading conflict theorist Kenneth Boulding argued that integrative power is
potentially the most potent form of power that there is--more so than exchange and force
(which make up the other two &quot;faces of power&quot; in his book the <a
href="../example/boul7514.htm"><em>Three Faces of Power</em></a>.) As Boulding points out,
even in war-torn societies, there are usually strong bonds between people on the same
side.&nbsp; Without such bonds, the group would disintegrate and continuation of the
conflict through force would become impossible. &nbsp; Hence, even force requires the
integrative system to be effective, in some form, in order to operate.</p>

<p>Yet, conflict does put severe strains on the integrative system, and makes break it
down to a considerable extent--especially between disputants, but sometimes within groups
as well.&nbsp; Typical problems that occur with the integrative system include the
assumption that it is not powerful, hence that it cannot be used effectively to pursue or
resolve a conflict.&nbsp; Another common problem is unskilled and ineffective use of
integrative power, while a third problem is the breakdown of integrative structures as a
conflict escalates.&nbsp; </p>
