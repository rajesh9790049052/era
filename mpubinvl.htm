<hr>

<p>Beginning in the 1960s, in the United States, a large number of laws were passed which
required government agencies at all levels to provide extensive opportunities for public
involvement in governmental decision making processes. Sometimes, however, the mechanisms
provided for such public involvement are ineffective and largely meaningless. For example,
agencies often hold public hearings in which they solicit public comments on a proposed
action. If those comments are then completely ignored, and the agency makes a decision
which is clearly opposite to the bulk of public opinion, the public is likely to withdraw
its support for both the decision making process and the decision itself. Likewise,
agencies often form citizen advisory committees which do not have decision making power,
but which are formed to give decision makers advice about pending decisions. If that
advice is routinely ignored, the advisory committee members are likely to quit and pursue
more confrontational approaches for influencing the decision making process. </p>

  <dd>This article discusses the difference in the ways the public and scientific experts
    assess uncertainty and risk. When people feel that they are left out of the risk
    assessment process they are likely to be very rigid in their assessments of acceptable
    risks, whereas when they are involved, they are more likely to make the necessary effort
    to really understand the situation and to make careful assessments and decisions.</dd>
