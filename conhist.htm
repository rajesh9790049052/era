<hr>

<p>Often disputes which appear to be &quot;new&quot; are actually repeat situations or
continuations of an underlying conflict or problem which has being going on for a long
time. When the parties involved are the same, the relationship to past similar disputes is
usually fairly obvious. However, individual parties may change, or particular
circumstances or precipitating events may change, leading the disputants to believe theirs
is a new or unique situation when it is actually not. </p>

<p>When disputes are part of a long-running conflict, they are often more complex, and
more deep-rooted than disputes which really are arising for the first time. For this
reason it is important to be aware of the conflict history, and realize the impact that
history has on the current situation and the parties' interpretation of that situation.
Understanding who was involved, what they old issues were, and how the conflict was
handled in the past is key to being able to confront the conflict effectively in the
present. Without such knowledge, disputants are likely to misinterpret what is currently
going on, and may well try to implement solutions that won't work or will make the
situation worse, not better.</p>

<p>The same thing is true if disputants ignore current, related disputes or conflicts.
Sometimes several related disputes are going on at once with overlapping parties or
issues. Sometimes broader political, economic, or social trends impact on a smaller-scale
dispute. If the impact of the related disputes or ongoing political, economic, or social
dynamics are ignored, the changes of responding to the immediate dispute situation
effectively is greatly reduced. </p>
