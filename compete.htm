<hr>

<p>Usually when people are involved in a conflict it is because they are prevented from
having or doing something that they want or need because someone or something is
preventing them attaining their goal. Usually, it is assumed that in order to get what
they want, it is necessary for the other side to not get what it wants. This is termed a
&quot;win-lose&quot; situation because the assumption is that if one side wins, the other
side must lose. </p>

<p>In some conflicts, this situation is unavoidable. If a resource is limited, and there
is not enough available to satisfy everyone, then the more one person has, the less
another gets. For instance, if two countries each need water from a river that flows
between them, and there is not enough in the river to meet each country's needs, then the
more one takes, the less the other gets. This is an inherently win-lose situation. </p>

<p>Other conflicts, however, are assumed to be win-lose, when they are not necessarily so.
Sometimes, it is possible to develop a solution which will meet both parties' interests or
needs simultaneously. If the conflict involves interests, this can be done by <a
href="../treatment/intframe.htm">interest-based reframing</a> and <a
href="../treatment/pricneg.htm">principled negotiation</a>. If the conflict involves
needs, this can be done by a needs analysis and <a href="../treatment/anps.htm">analytical
problem solving</a>.</p>

<p>However, especially in long-lasting and deep-rooted conflict, people assume that the
situation is a win-lose problem, and they respond very aggressively, or competitively,
trying to get as much as possible for themselves, and consequently as little as possible
for their opponents. This tends to increase the opposition of the other side, cause the
conflict to escalate, and make finding any solution-even an interim solution-much more
difficult. A cooperative approach, on the other hand, can often improve even win-lose
situations, as the parties can learn more about what each needs and then determine
together the fairest way to divide things up. </p>
