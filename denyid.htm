<p></font><font size="3">Identity is one of several fundamental human needs that underlie
many intractable conflicts. Human needs theorists argue that conflicts over needs are
fundamentally different from conflicts over interests, because interests are negotiable,
whereas needs are not. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">One of the most common types of needs conflicts are
conflicts over identity. These conflicts occur when a person or a group feels that his or
her sense of self--who one is--is threatened, or denied legitimacy or respect. One's sense
of self is so fundamental and so important, not only to one's self-esteem but also to how
one interprets the rest of the world, that any threat to identity is likely to produce a
strong response. Typically, this response is both aggressive and defensive, and can
escalate quickly into an intractable conflict. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Identity is the primary issue in most racial and ethnic
conflicts. It is also a key issue in many gender and family conflicts, when men and women
disagree on the proper role or &quot;place&quot; of the other, or children disagree with
their parents about who is in control of their lives and how they present themselves to
the outside world. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Identity conflicts can be especially difficult to resolve.
The opponent is often viewed as evil--even nonhuman--and their views and feelings not
worthy of attention. In addition, sitting down with the opponent can be seen as a threat
to one's own identity, so even beginning efforts at reconciliation can be extremely
difficult. Nevertheless, identity conflicts can be moderated, or even reconciled if the
parties want such an outcome and are willing to work for it over a long period of time.</font></p>

    diplomacy failed in the case of the former Yugoslavia.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the reasons
    was that the need for identity of each of the cultural groups in the region was not
    adequately&nbsp;addressed, leading each group to believe that violence was the only method
    available to defend their own identity. </font></dd>
