<hr>

<p>In intractable conflict situations successful limitation of the complicating factors is
unlikely to resolve the underlying conflict.&nbsp; These conflicts usually involve <a
href="histake.htm">high stakes distribution questions</a>, <a href="valdiff.htm">fundamental
moral disagreements</a>, <a href="dominatn.htm">questions of social status</a>, or <a
href="denyid.htm">challenges to group identity</a>.&nbsp; All of these issues are
generally seen as very important and generally non-negotiable.&nbsp; People will not
change their basic values; they will not renounce their group identity; they will not give
up their security or their status without a long struggle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In theoretical terms, disputants can approach such core conflict problems in any of
three ways.&nbsp; The first (and most common way) is through the use of force--the use of
violent or nonviolent methods of coercion designed to get one's opponent to do something
that they do not want to do.&nbsp; The second approach is exchange.&nbsp; Although the
fundamental aspects of the conflict may be non-negotiable, there are often some issues
that are amenable to compromise or win-win outcomes, which may then pave the way to more
fundamental agreements at a later time.&nbsp; The third approach is the use of the
integrative system--turning to the bonds of common identity, common values, or common
needs that can bring disputing parties back together.&nbsp; Within each of these
categories are a large number of strategies that can be used to try to prevail in (or
resolve) an intractable conflict.</p>

<p>Although we discuss these three categories separately, most often disputants do some of
each.&nbsp; They may use a large amount of force, tempered by a small amount of persuasion
(the integrative system) and end with negotiation (exchange) once the relative power
levels are determined.&nbsp; Or they may use a large dose of persuasion, with a small
amount of force and some exchange to try to work out the specifics, after the general
ideas are agreed to.&nbsp; These mixtures of strategies are what we call the &quot;<a
href="../treatment/psmix.htm">power strategy mix</a>.&quot;&nbsp; </p>

<p>The following four sections discuss, first, force-based strategies to address core
issues; second, integrative strategies; third, exchange strategies and lastly, combination
strategies--common strategies that combine more than one type of power.</p>
