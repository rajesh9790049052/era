<p>We use the term &quot;defense&quot; to refer to a non-threatening strategy for
responding to threats made by an opponent. It works by making it impossible for the
threatening party to effectively carry out their threats. In classic military terms,
defense is an impregnable fortress capable of repelling, at low cost and over the long
term, any conceivable attack by an opponent. While defensive strategies are effectively
able to block an attack, they do not simultaneously give the party an offensive capability
which would allow them to successfully attack their opponents. Defensive strategies
produce stable situations in which everyone is secure within their own sphere of
influence, and no one thinks that they have a realistic chance of successfully invading
the sphere of influence of an opponent. </p>

<p>While these principles are most commonly applied to physical threats, other power
relationships can be structured in ways which enhance security and promote individual
freedom by reducing the ability of people to threaten others unless they are acting in
socially unacceptable ways. For example, political systems which place a high degree of
control in the hands of local authorities can be seen as way of protecting a community
from the unwanted political influence of outsiders. Similarly, legal principles which
enforce individual rights and protection from criminal behavior can be seen as defensive
because they limit the ability of others to threaten individuals. </p>

<p>The problem with purely defensive strategies is that the technical characteristics of
many conflict situations may make them unworkable. For example, in spite of the enormous
resources devoted to President Reagan's Star Wars program, there is no realistic prospect
for an effective defense against a large scale nuclear missile attack. Similarly, most
army, navy and air force units can be relatively easily converted from a defensive to an
offensive roles, and the two often tend to become intertwined as governments, like the
United States, for instance, have &quot;Departments of Defense,&quot; which while they are
supposedly only empowered to act in defense of the United States and its interests, in
reality, they may act offensively at times as well.</p>
