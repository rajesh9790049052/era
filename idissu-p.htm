<hr>

<p>In addition to failing to identify people or groups who might be involved in a
conflict, disputants can also overlook issues which are important to others, but are not
important to themselves. Often people will not realize that there is more than one way to
see a situation, and that other people or groups may see the conflict differently than
they do. </p>

<p>This is especially true in highly escalated and intractable conflicts. As conflicts
escalate the number of issues in dispute tends to increase. Initially, a dispute may
center around a particular event or problem, which is very clear. As the dispute goes on,
however, the parties bring up more and more related problems, expanding the number of
issues in contention. In the case of intractable conflicts, some of which have gone on for
years, the numbers of issues may be in the tens or even hundreds. Sometimes the initial
issues may recede in importance, being replaced by completely different problems and
issues. It can become very difficult to even identify all of the issues in conflict, let
alone solve them. Yet if important issues are not identified, it is impossible to develop
solutions to the conflict that will successfully resolve it.</p>
