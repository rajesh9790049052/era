<p>In many cases, the parties assume that superior military power will lead to resolution
of disputes on favorable terms. In some cases, it may result in clear victory on the
battlefield, while in other cases the opponents may feel so threatened that they simply
submit or even surrender. </p>

<p>In reality, however, military strategies are often much less successful. There are
numerous cases in which military options are likely to be unable to advance the parties'
objectives.&nbsp; For example, in many cases, the pursuit of military options forces
opponents to develop their own counterforce. Then the result is often a very expensive
arms race which gives the parties the ability to inflict enormous damage upon one another,
but often, not the ability to accomplish their goals.&nbsp; The military standoffs which
arms races create also tend to be unstable and can easily escalate into all-out
confrontation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even in situations in which force is used, it is common for
neither side to be able to win without incurring much higher costs than they are willing
to endure.&nbsp; This can lead to what is called a &quot;hurting stalemate,&quot; in which
both sides continue to inflict damage on the other, with neither side able to prevail.</p>

<p>Even when the use of military force is successful, it tends to create such a powerful
backlash, causing continuing hatred and hostility to be inevitable. This can make the
military option a formula for continuing conflict, rather than a strategy for resolution
and reconciliation. </p>

<p>There are also problems with using military force against parties who employ
non-violent resistance strategies. In these cases, the use of military force is likely to
be widely seen as illegitimate. This means that increases in military power are often
accompanied with a corresponding decrease in integrative power and legitimacy. </p>

<p>It is relatively inexpensive to employ military strategies to make threats; however,
the loss of life involved in military confrontation can make it very difficult to carry
out those threats. Even when expected casualties are minor by military standards,
political impact of these casualties can make use of this type of force especially
difficult. </p>
