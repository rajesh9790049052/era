<p>Dictatorial decision making processes are the extreme case of vested interests, in
which one person or a small group of people have the power to govern an entire country or
region, making decisions which favor themselves and their cohorts over the interests and
needs of the society as a whole. While this has been the normal form of decision making in
much of the world for thousands of years, more and more societies worldwide are rejecting
this approach and trying to transform their governments into more democratic systems. The
transition is difficult, however, and dictatorial processes tend to persist in much of the
world. They are especially powerful because of many dictator's willingness to use violent
force to keep their people in line. </p>

<p>A detailed discussion of how to transform dictatorships into democracies is beyond what
we are able to do in this program. However, a few observations suggest ways to approach
this problem. </p>

<p>First, Gene Sharp, a political scientist and expert in nonviolent action, argues that
every leader's power is dependent on the consent of the people who are governed. If they
withdraw this consent, the government will fall. This is obvious for democratic
governments, which will lose the next election, but it is also true for dictatorships. The
fall of the Communist governments in the U.S.S.R. and Eastern Europe is an excellent
example. Once the populations of these countries lost faith in their governments, the
governments crumpled-mostly without violence. External pressure (from outside countries)
can also hasten this process (as it did in South Africa, for example), though other
countries (such as Iraq) seem to be able to withstand a tremendous amount of outside
pressure without losing internal control. </p>

<p>Fear, of course, often prevents widespread opposition to dictatorial regimes.
Heavy-handed police tactics can prevent the communication and organization necessary for
organizing a successful resistance. Yet Gene Sharp and other scholars of nonviolent action
argue that any regime can be overthrown without violence, no matter what level of
oppression, if the people decide they want to do it and are willing to make the sacrifices
necessary to succeed. </p>

<p>The problem of dictatorial governance can also occur at the local level. Sometime local
politicians will abuse the power granted them, using very strong tactics to maintain
control over their small domain. Usually this kind of abuse of authority is much easier to
deal with, as the politicians can usually be voted out of office if they are perceived to
be abusing their power.</p>
