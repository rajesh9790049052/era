<p>The term &quot;muddle&quot; describes a decision making or conflict process which is so
complicated that the parties are unable to approach the issues in a rational or sensible
way. This tends to produce decisions and settlements which are later regretted, which
likely will not work, and which the parties would not have accepted if they has understood
the situation more clearly.There are two major areas in which complexity presents serious
difficulties--factual complexity and procedural complexity. </p>

<p>Technical Complexity </p>

<p>Technical complexity involves difficulties in fact finding, technical information, and
the systematic identification and analysis of options and their likely consequences. For
example, conflicts involving the technical analysis of risks (of nuclear power plants,
chemical plants, oil refineries, agricultural herbicides and pesticides) are often so
complex that they lead to this kind of problem.&nbsp; So too are conflicts over the
economic effects of alternative trade policies or the environmental impacts of mining,
logging and other extractive industries. In these and countless similar situations,
careful analyses by highly trained experts can play a crucial role in helping the parties
decide which options are worth fighting for and which ones are worth fighting against.
Problems arise, however, when different experts come to opposite conclusions, as often
happens when each side hires its own experts.&nbsp; To avoid this, it is often useful to
develop a data mediation or joint fact-finding process, in which the experts cooperate in
demystifying the complex technical information as much as possible.&nbsp; Similar
expert-based, fact-finding procedures can be used to help the parties assess their
military, political, and/or legal to a particular conflict situation.&nbsp; All of these
are areas where the judgement of trained professionals can help the parties make much
wiser decisions. </p>

<p>Procedural Complexity </p>

<p>Complexity muddle can also involve procedural issues. Negotiation strategies which can
reliably help small numbers of people find win-win solutions to small scale problems can
easily break down in situations involving large numbers of parties and issues.
&nbsp; Public policy conflicts are often extremely complex processes which may have
hundreds or even thousands of actors taking an active role in the dispute process. These
actors are likely to be organized into a&nbsp; number of different interest groups,
creating a multi-party conflicts which cannot be effectively approached using a simple two
party conflict models. </p>

<p>Frequently conflicts consist of a series of interlocking conflicts in which the efforts
of parties to advance their interests in unrelated areas clash in ways which create
additional points of conflict (involving the most appropriate allocation of government
resources, for example) or create new opportunities for cooperation (the building of a
coalition which attempts to support business or environmental interests, for example.)
These conflicts are likely to involve a long series of often overlapping dispute episodes
addressing different aspects of the overall conflict. In some cases, these individual
disputes may be negotiated or mediated. Other disputes may be addressed through legal or
political processes, public demonstrations, or police or military action. Often several of
these processes are pursued simultaneously or sequentially, further complicating the
process.</p>

<p>Dealing with procedural complexity </p>

<p>There are two keys to dealing with procedural complexity. First and most important is
not to promise to do more than can be done. It is unrealistic to expect a single effort to
resolve every problem. The thing to do is to analyze the full scope of conflict, identify
those conflict problems which are having the most severe adverse effects, and develop
intervention designed to limit those problems. In some cases this may involve a negotiated
resolution of some of the sub issues.&nbsp; In other cases, it may involve efforts to
limit escalation or foster better communication, or showing the parties nonviolent
strategies for better advancing their interests. An intervention which is modest,
realistic, and works is superior to an overly ambitious plan which fails and undermines
the parties' confidence in alternative approaches. </p>

<p>Also likely to be useful are approaches which handle a group of related conflicts with
a standard procedure.&nbsp; By designing a &quot;dispute management system,&quot; related
disputes can be grouped together and handled in the same way, simplifying the process and
the cost of individual dispute handling.&nbsp; In addition skill building or capacity
building projects which improve the ability of individual people to deal with their own
conflicts can help deal with complexity from the &quot;ground up.&quot;</p>
