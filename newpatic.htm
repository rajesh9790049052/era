<p><font SIZE="+2">Conflicts (and many disputes) are long-term processes which continue
over months or years. As conflicts proceed, participants develop a long history of
interactions with one another. They get to know each other personally. They also get to
know interests, positions, and actions of the various parties as well as the history of
efforts to better deal with the conflict. When new individuals become active in the
conflict, they are likely to lack this base of experience and, as a result, they are more
likely to take actions that they would not have taken if the better understood the
conflict's history. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+2">The key to limiting this problem is finding&nbsp; some mechanism for
preserving the conflict's history and providing new participants with access to that
information. It is important that this mechanism provide people entering the conflict
which information that is as unbiased as possible. If new people get their information
from a single source, they are also likely inherit that person's stereotypes and
animosities. It is also important, however, to encourage new participants to try new
approaches which may allow them to find ways around obstacles which earlier participants
were unable to surmount.</font></p>
