<h1 align="center">Cultural Barriers to Effective Communication</h1>

<hr>

<p>Effective communication with people of different cultures is especially challenging.
Cultures provide people with ways of thinking--ways of seeing, hearing, and interpreting
the world. Thus the same words can mean different things to people from different
cultures, even when they talk the &quot;same&quot; language. When the languages are
different, and translation has to be used to communicate, the potential for
misunderstandings increases.</p>

<p>Stella Ting-Toomey describes three ways in which culture interferes with effective
cross-cultural understanding. First is what she calls &quot;cognitive constraints.&quot;
These are the frames of reference or world views that provide a backdrop that all new
information is compared to or inserted into. </p>

<p>Second are &quot;behavior constraints.&quot; Each culture has its own rules about
proper behavior which affect verbal and nonverbal communication. Whether one looks the
other person in the eye-or not; whether one says what one means overtly or talks around
the issue; how close the people stand to each other when they are talking--all of these
and many more are rules of politeness which differ from culture to culture. </p>

<p>Ting-Toomey's third factor is &quot;emotional constraints.&quot; Different cultures
regulate the display of emotion differently. Some cultures get very emotional when they
are debating an issue.&nbsp; They yell, they cry, they exhibit their anger, fear,
frustration, and other feelings openly. Other cultures try to keep their emotions hidden,
exhibiting or sharing only the &quot;rational&quot; or factual aspects of the situation. </p>

<p>All of these differences tend to lead to communication problems. If the people involved
are not aware of the potential for such problems, they are even more likely to fall victim
to them, although it takes more than awareness to overcome these problems and communicate
effectively across cultures. </p>
