  <p><font SIZE="+2">The complexity of many conflicts means that scientific and technical
  analysis is often essential to adequately understand the costs, benefits, and risks of the
  many options available.</font></p>
  <p><font SIZE="+2">While experts can identify available options and analyze the likely
  results of adopting each option, they cannot and should not be responsible for deciding
  which options is the best or which should be pursued. That decision should be left to the
  larger society, since it requires the making of value judgements about what kind of
  society is most desirable. </font></p>
  <p><font SIZE="+2">The making of wise decisions does, however, require that decision
  makers and the public understand the meaning of the experts' technical analysis. While
  they don't need to know exactly how the studies were conducted, or how the conclusions
  were reached, (though that is helpful), they do need to understand in practical terms, the
  meaning of the conclusions, how reliable, and how credible they are.&nbsp; This usually
  requires some type of mechanism for explaining technical studies to non-technical
  audiences.</font></p>
  <p><font SIZE="+2">Possible mechanisms to do this include:</font></p>
  <p><font SIZE="+2"><a href="../treatment/tprimer.htm">Technical Primers</a> - short,
  well-written documents (or videotapes) in which credible experts explain what everyone
  needs to know to sensibly interpret technical studies.</font></p>
  <p><font SIZE="+2">Public Meetings with the Experts -- public meetings in which technical
  experts with a high degree credibility present the practical implications of their
  findings and answer questions.</font></p>
  <p><a href="../treatment/oversite.htm"><font SIZE="+2">Expert Consultants' </font><font
  size="4">Oversight<strong> </strong></font></a><font SIZE="+2">- technical experts who are
  actually hired to work with the parties to help them better interpret and assess technical
  studies.</font></p>

    <dt><strong><a href="../example/sand7502.htm">Peter M. Sandman--Explaining Environmental
      Risk</a></strong></dt>
    <dd>This article explains that the public assesses risk and uncertainty very differently
      from experts.&nbsp; It then suggests ways in which risk can be explained to the public so
      that they can make informed decisions. </dd>

      Radiation Monitoring Program </strong></a></dt>
    <dd>This is a description of the aftermath of the accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear
      power plant in Pennsylvania (U.S.) Residents' fears about potential risks of cleanup
      activities were high due to distrust of the plant operators and regulators.&nbsp; The
      described Citizen Radiation Monitoring Program solved the credibility problem and allowed
      the clean up to go ahead as planned.</dd>
